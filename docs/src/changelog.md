## **Release 5.0.1 - HOTFIX - April 12th, 2023**
- fix: copy checks when inheriting
  	- When inheriting checks, slash commands would pass in their own checks to the subcommand. This makes sense logically, however, what wasn't being caught was that these were being passed by reference, and so any edit to the checks in one subcommand would affect potentially EVERY command.
- build: Ensure opus `dll`s are included in pypi releases


## **Release 5.0.0 - April 10th, 2023**
- Python3.10 is now the minimum supported python version
- The cache takes centre stage - accessing client.http should not be required
- The client is now substantially more error tolerant. Your commands can fail spectacularly, and the client wont drop an event
- Full API coverage (excluding some pre-release bits)
- Voice Playback and recording built-in
vMany of the old exts are now merged in (check out [here](https://github.com/interactions-py/interactions.py/tree/5.0.0/interactions/ext))
- Performance is improved
- UX has subjectively improved - this is because this release was based heavily on feedback from users
