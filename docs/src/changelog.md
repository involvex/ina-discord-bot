## 5.0.1 - April 12th, 2023
- Fix: copy checks when inheriting
      - When inheriting checks, slash commands would pass in their own checks to the subcommand. This makes sense logically, however, what wasn't being caught was that these were being passed by reference, and so any edit to the checks in one subcommand would affect potentially EVERY command.
- Build: Ensure opus `dll`s are included in pypi releases
