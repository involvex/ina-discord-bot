# Events

Events are dispatched whenever a subscribed event gets sent by Discord.

## What Events Can I Get

What events you subscribe to are defined at startup by setting your `Intents`.

`Intents.DEFAULT` is a good place to start if your bot is new and small, otherwise, it is recommended to take your time and go through them one by one.
```python
bot = Client(intents=Intents.DEFAULT)
bot.start("Put your token here")
```

For more information, please visit the API reference [here](/interactions.py/API Reference/API Reference/models/Discord/enums/#internal.models.discord.enums.Intents).

## Hey Listen!!!

Now you can receive events. To respond to them, you need to register a callback. Callbacks should be lower-case, use `_` instead of spaces and start with `on_`.
Depending on how you register your callbacks that's not a requirement, but it is a good habit nonetheless.

For example, the event callback for the `ChannelCreate` event should be called `on_channel_create`.

You can find all events and their signatures [here](/interactions.py/API Reference/API Reference/events/discord/).

Be aware that your `Intents` must be set to receive the event you are looking for.

There are two ways to register events. **Decorators** are the recommended way to do this.

=== ":one: Decorators"
    ```python
    from interactions import listen
    from interactions.api.events import ChannelCreate

    @listen()
    async def on_channel_create(event: ChannelCreate):
        # this event is called when a channel is created in a guild where the bot is

        print(f"Channel created with name: {event.channel.name}")
    ```

    You can also use `@listen` with any function names:

    ```python
    @listen(ChannelCreate)
    async def my_function(event: ChannelCreate):
        # you can pass the event
        ...

    @listen("on_channel_create")
    async def my_function(event: ChannelCreate):
        # you can also pass the event name as a string
        ...

    @listen()
    async def my_function(event: ChannelCreate):
        # you can also use the typehint of `event`
        ...
    ```

=== ":two: Manual Registration"
    You can also register the events manually. This gives you the most flexibility, but it's not the cleanest.

    ```python
    from interactions import Listener
    from interactions.api.events import ChannelCreate

    async def on_channel_create(event: ChannelCreate):
        # this event is called when a channel is created in a guild where the bot is

        print(f"Channel created with name: {event.channel.name}")


    bot = Client(intents=Intents.DEFAULT)
    bot.add_listener(Listener(func=on_channel_create, event="on_channel_create"))
    bot.start("Put your token here")
    ```
