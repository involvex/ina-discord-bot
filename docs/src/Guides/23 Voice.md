# Voice Support

So you want to start playing some ðŸŽµtunesðŸŽ¶ in voice channels? Well let's get that going for you.

First you're going to want to get the voice dependencies installed:
```
pip install dis-snek[voice]
```

Then you'll need to download [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) and place it in your project directory or PATH.

Now you've got those; let's make a simple play command to get you started.

```python
import interactions
from interactions.api.voice.audio import AudioVolume


@interactions.slash_command("play", "play a song!")
@interactions.slash_option("song", "The song to play", 3, True)
async def play(self, ctx: interactions.InteractionContext, song: str):
    if not ctx.voice_state:
        # if we haven't already joined a voice channel
        # join the authors vc
        await ctx.author.voice.channel.connect()

    # Get the audio using YTDL
    audio = await AudioVolume(song)
    await ctx.send(f"Now Playing: **{song}**")
    # Play the audio
    await ctx.voice_state.play(audio)
```

Now just join a voice channel, and type run the "play" slash command with a song of your choice.

Congratulations! You've got a music-bot.

## But what about local music?

If you want to play your own files, you can do that too! Create an `AudioVolume` object and away you go.

!!! note
    If your audio is already encoded, use the standard `Audio` object instead. You'll lose volume manipulation, however.

```python
import interactions
from interactions.api.voice.audio import AudioVolume


@interactions.slash_command("play", "play a song!")
async def play_file(ctx: interactions.InteractionContext):
    audio = AudioVolume("some_file.wav")
    await ctx.voice_state.play(audio)
```

Check out [Active Voice State](/interactions.py/API Reference/API Reference/models/Internal/active_voice_state/) for a list of available methods and attributes.

## Okay, but what about Soundcloud?

interactions.py has an extension library called [`NAFFAudio`](https://github.com/NAFTeam/NAFF-Audio) which can help with that.
It has an object called `YTAudio` which can be used to play audio from Soundcloud and other video platforms.

```
pip install naff_audio
```

```python
from naff_audio import YTAudio

audio = await YTAudio.from_url("https://soundcloud.com/rick-astley-official/never-gonna-give-you-up-4")
await voice_state.play(audio)
```

`NAFFAudio` also contains other useful features for audio-bots. Check it out if that's your *jam*.
