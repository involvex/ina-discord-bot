# Migration From discord.py

1. interactions.py requires python 3.10 (as compared to dpy's 3.5), you may need to upgrade python.
     - If you see `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement naff (from versions: none)` when trying to `pip install NAFF`, this is your problem.

2. Classes/Models
     - Your client is `interactions.Client`.
     - Cogs are `Extensions`.
     - `Member` is not a subclass of `User`, if you're using `isinstance`, you'll want to check both explicitly.

3. Extensions (Cogs)
     - These work mostly the same, with a few notable changes:
     - Your setup function doesn't need to do `bot.add_cog()`.  Simply call `MyCog(bot)`, and it'll automatically register itself.
     - Extensions already define `self.bot`, you don't need to do that in your `__init__` function.
     - For a full example, see [here](/Guides/20 Extensions/)

4. Event handlers
     - Register event handlers with `@interactions.listen`
     - Where possible, we use the official names for events, most notably `on_message_create` instead of dpy's `on_message`.
       - A full list can be found [here](/interactions.py/API Reference/API Reference/events/discord/).
     - Event details are stored on a model, passed as a single parameter. (eg: `on_member_update(before, after)` becomes `on_member_update(event)`, where event has a `.before` and `.after`.
     - `on_ready` is called whenever the gateway resumes. If you are looking to run stuff *once* upon startup, use the `on_startup` handler instead.
     - For more details, read [the Events guide](/Guides/10 Events).

5. Migrating your commands
     - If you were already using dpy's command extension, migrating to slash commands is fairly simple.  You just need to convert the decorators as per the [Slash Commands guide](/Guides/03 Creating Commands/)
     - If you wish to keep using prefixed commands (sometimes called message or text-based commands), you can use our prefixed command extension, which has an [extensive guide for them](/Guides/07 Creating Prefixed Commands). The syntax should be very similar to discord.py with a few exceptions.
     - If you were manually handling commands with `on_message`, you'll probably need to figure it out yourself, as this guide doesn't know how you wrote your parser.  Consider using the provided command handlers.

??? Note
    This guide was written based on the experiences of porting a small handful of bots.  There may be gotchas that we did not encounter.  If you run into anything you'd like to have known, let us know in our Discord, and we'll add it to this document.
