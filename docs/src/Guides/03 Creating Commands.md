# Slash Commands

So you want to make a slash command (or interaction, as they are officially called), but don't know how to get started?
Then this is the right place for you.

## Your First Command

To create an interaction, simply define an asynchronous function and use the `@slash_command()` decorator above it.

Interactions need to be responded to within 3 seconds. To do this, use `await ctx.send()`.
If your code needs more time, don't worry. You can use `await ctx.defer()` to increase the time until you need to respond to the command to 15 minutes.
```python
from interactions import slash_command, SlashContext

@slash_command(name="my_command", description="My first command :)")
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext):
    await ctx.send("Hello World")

@slash_command(name="my_long_command", description="My second command :)")
async def my_long_command_function(ctx: SlashContext):
    # need to defer it, otherwise, it fails
    await ctx.defer()

    # do stuff for a bit
    await asyncio.sleep(600)

    await ctx.send("Hello World")
```
???+ note
    Command names must be lowercase and can only contain `-` and `_` as special symbols and must not contain spaces.

When testing, it is recommended to use non-global commands, as they sync instantly.
For that, you can either define `scopes` in every command or set `debug_scope` in the bot instantiation which sets the scope automatically for all commands.

You can define non-global commands by passing a list of guild ids to `scopes` in the interaction creation.
```python
@slash_command(name="my_command", description="My first command :)", scopes=[870046872864165888])
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext):
    await ctx.send("Hello World")
```

For more information, please visit the API reference [here](/interactions.py/API Reference/API Reference/models/Internal/application_commands/#interactions.models.internal.application_commands.slash_command).

## Subcommands

If you have multiple commands that fit under the same category, subcommands are perfect for you.

Let's define a basic subcommand:
```python
@slash_command(
    name="base",
    description="My command base",
    group_name="group",
    group_description="My command group",
    sub_cmd_name="command",
    sub_cmd_description="My command",
)
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext):
    await ctx.send("Hello World")
```

This will show up in discord as `/base group command`. There are more ways to add additional subcommands:

=== ":one: Decorator"
    ```python
    @my_command_function.subcommand(
        group_name="group",
        group_description="My command group",
        sub_cmd_name="sub",
        sub_cmd_description="My subcommand",
    )
    async def my_second_command_function(ctx: SlashContext):
        await ctx.send("Hello World")
    ```

=== ":two: Repeat Definition"
    ```python
    @slash_command(
        name="base",
        description="My command base",
        group_name="group",
        group_description="My command group",
        sub_cmd_name="second_command",
        sub_cmd_description="My second command",
    )
    async def my_second_command_function(ctx: SlashContext):
        await ctx.send("Hello World")
    ```

    **Note:** This is particularly useful if you want to split subcommands into different files.

=== ":three: Class Definition"
    ```python
    from interactions import SlashCommand

    base = SlashCommand(name="base", description="My command base")
    group = base.group(name="group", description="My command group")

    @group.subcommand(sub_cmd_name="second_command", sub_cmd_description="My second command")
    async def my_second_command_function(ctx: SlashContext):
        await ctx.send("Hello World")
    ```

For all of these, the "group" parts are optional, allowing you to do `/base command` instead.

???+ note
    You cannot mix group subcommands and non-group subcommands into one base command - you must either use all group subcommands or normal subcommands.


## Options

Interactions can also have options. There are a bunch of different [types of options](/interactions.py/API Reference/API Reference/models/Internal/application_commands/#interactions.models.internal.application_commands.OptionType):

| Option Type               | Return Type                                | Description                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OptionType.STRING`      | `str`                                      | Limit the input to a string.                                                                |
| `OptionType.INTEGER`     | `int`                                      | Limit the input to a integer.                                                               |
| `OptionType.NUMBER`      | `float`                                    | Limit the input to a float.                                                                 |
| `OptionType.BOOLEAN`     | `bool`                                     | Let the user choose either `True` or `False`.                                               |
| `OptionType.USER`        | `Member` in guilds, else `User`            | Let the user choose a discord user from an automatically-generated list of options.         |
| `OptionType.CHANNEL`     | `GuildChannel` in guilds, else `DMChannel` | Let the user choose a discord channel from an automatically-generated list of options.      |
| `OptionType.ROLE`        | `Role`                                     | Let the user choose a discord role from an automatically-generated list of options.         |
| `OptionType.MENTIONABLE` | `DiscordObject`                            | Let the user chose any discord mentionable from an automatically generated list of options. |
| `OptionType.ATTACHMENT`  | `Attachment`                               | Let the user upload an attachment.                                                          |

Now that you know all the options you have for options, you can opt into adding options to your interaction.

You do that by using the `@slash_option()` decorator and passing the option name as a function parameter:
```python
from interactions import OptionType, slash_option

@slash_command(name="my_command", ...)
@slash_option(
    name="integer_option",
    description="Integer Option",
    required=True,
    opt_type=OptionType.INTEGER
)
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, integer_option: int):
    await ctx.send(f"You input {integer_option}")
```

Options can either be required or not. If an option is not required, make sure to set a default value for them.

Always make sure to define all required options first, this is a Discord requirement!
```python
@slash_command(name="my_command", ...)
@slash_option(
    name="integer_option",
    description="Integer Option",
    required=False,
    opt_type=OptionType.INTEGER
)
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, integer_option: int = 5):
    await ctx.send(f"You input {integer_option}")
```

For more information, please visit the API reference [here](/interactions.py/API Reference/API Reference/models/Internal/application_commands/#interactions.models.internal.application_commands.slash_option).

### Restricting Options

If you are using an `OptionType.CHANNEL` option, you can restrict the channel a user can choose by setting `channel_types`:
```python
from interactions import ChannelType, GuildText, OptionType, SlashContext, slash_command, slash_option

@slash_command(name="my_command")
@slash_option(
    name="channel_option",
    description="Channel Option",
    required=True,
    opt_type=OptionType.CHANNEL,
    channel_types=[ChannelType.GUILD_TEXT],
)
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, channel_option: GuildText):
    await channel_option.send("This is a text channel in a guild")

    await ctx.send("...")
```

You can also set an upper and lower limit for both `OptionType.INTEGER` and `OptionType.NUMBER` by setting `min_value` and `max_value`:
```python
@slash_command(name="my_command", ...)
@slash_option(
    name="integer_option",
    description="Integer Option",
    required=True,
    opt_type=OptionType.INTEGER,
    min_value=10,
    max_value=15
)
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, integer_option: int):
    await ctx.send(f"You input {integer_option} which is always between 10 and 15")
```

The same can be done with the length of an option when using `OptionType.STRING` by setting `min_length` and `max_length`:
```python
@slash_command(name="my_command", ...)
@slash_option(
    name="string_option",
    description="String Option",
    required=True,
    opt_type=OptionType.STRING,
    min_length=5,
    max_length=10
)
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, string_option: str):
    await ctx.send(f"You input `{string_option}` which is between 5 and 10 characters long")
```

!!! danger "Option Names"
    Be aware that the option `name` and the function parameter need to be the same (In this example both are `integer_option`).


## Option Choices

If your users ~~are dumb~~ constantly misspell specific strings, it might be wise to set up choices.
With choices, the user can no longer freely input whatever they want, instead, they must choose from a pre-defined list.

To create a choice, simply fill `choices` in `@slash_option()`. An option can have up to 25 choices. The name of a choice is what will be shown in the Discord client of the user, while the value is what the bot will receive in its callback. Both can be the same.
```python
from interactions import SlashCommandChoice

@slash_command(name="my_command", ...)
@slash_option(
    name="integer_option",
    description="Integer Option",
    required=True,
    opt_type=OptionType.INTEGER,
    choices=[
        SlashCommandChoice(name="One", value=1),
        SlashCommandChoice(name="Two", value=2)
    ]
)
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, integer_option: int):
    await ctx.send(f"You input {integer_option} which is either 1 or 2")
```

For more information, please visit the API reference [here](/interactions.py/API Reference/API Reference/models/Internal/application_commands/#interactions.models.internal.application_commands.SlashCommandChoice).

## Autocomplete / More than 25 choices needed

If you have more than 25 choices the user can choose from, or you want to give a dynamic list of choices depending on what the user is currently typing, then you will need autocomplete options.
The downside is that you need to supply the choices on request, making this a bit more tricky to set up.

To use autocomplete options, set `autocomplete=True` in `@slash_option()`:
```python
@slash_command(name="my_command", ...)
@slash_option(
    name="string_option",
    description="String Option",
    required=True,
    opt_type=OptionType.STRING,
    autocomplete=True
)
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, string_option: str):
    await ctx.send(f"You input {string_option}")
```

Then you need to register the autocomplete callback, aka the function Discord calls when users fill in the option.

In there, you have three seconds to return whatever choices you want to the user. In this example we will simply return their input with "a", "b" or "c" appended:
```python
from interactions import AutocompleteContext

@my_command_function.autocomplete("string_option")
async def autocomplete(self, ctx: AutocompleteContext):
    string_option_input = ctx.input_text  # can be empty
    # you can use ctx.kwargs.get("name") to get the current state of other options - note they can be empty too

    # make sure you respond within three seconds
    await ctx.send(
        choices=[
            {
                "name": f"{string_option_input}a",
                "value": f"{string_option_input}a",
            },
            {
                "name": f"{string_option_input}b",
                "value": f"{string_option_input}b",
            },
            {
                "name": f"{string_option_input}c",
                "value": f"{string_option_input}c",
            },
        ]
    )
```

## Command definition without decorators

There are currently four different ways to define interactions, one does not need any decorators at all.

=== ":one: Multiple Decorators"

    ```python
    @slash_command(name="my_command", description="My first command :)")
    @slash_option(
        name="integer_option",
        description="Integer Option",
        required=True,
        opt_type=OptionType.INTEGER
    )
    async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, integer_option: int):
        await ctx.send(f"You input {integer_option}")
    ```

=== ":two: Single Decorator"

    ```python
    from interactions import SlashCommandOption

    @slash_command(
        name="my_command",
        description="My first command :)",
        options=[
            SlashCommandOption(
                name="integer_option",
                description="Integer Option",
                required=True,
                type=OptionType.INTEGER
            )
        ]
    )
    async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, integer_option: int):
        await ctx.send(f"You input {integer_option}")
    ```

=== ":three: Function Annotations"

    ```python
    from interactions import slash_int_option

    @slash_command(name="my_command", description="My first command :)")
    async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, integer_option: slash_int_option("Integer Option")):
        await ctx.send(f"You input {integer_option}")
    ```

=== ":four: Manual Registration"

    ```python
    from interactions import SlashCommandOption

    async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, integer_option: int):
        await ctx.send(f"You input {integer_option}")

    bot.add_interaction(
        command=SlashCommand(
            name="my_command",
            description="My first command :)",
            options=[
                SlashCommandOption(
                    name="integer_option",
                    description="Integer Option",
                    required=True,
                    type=OptionType.INTEGER
                )
            ]
        )
    )
    ```

## Restrict commands using permissions

It is possible to disable interactions (slash commands as well as context menus) for users that do not have a set of permissions.

This functionality works for **permissions**, not to confuse with roles. If you want to restrict some command if the user does not have a certain role, this cannot be done on the bot side. However, it can be done on the Discord server side, in the Server Settings > Integrations page.

!!!warning Administrators
    Remember that administrators of a Discord server have all permissions and therefore will always see the commands.

    If you do not want admins to be able to overwrite your permissions, or the permissions are not flexible enough for you, you should use [checks][checks].

In this example, we will limit access to the command to members with the `MANAGE_EVENTS` and `MANAGE_THREADS` permissions.
There are two ways to define permissions.

=== ":one: Decorators"

    ```python
    from interactions import Permissions, slash_default_member_permission

    @slash_command(name="my_command")
    @slash_default_member_permission(Permissions.MANAGE_EVENTS | Permissions.MANAGE_THREADS)
    async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext):
        ...
    ```

=== ":two: Function Definition"

    ```python
    from interactions import Permissions

    @slash_command(
        name="my_command",
        default_member_permissions=Permissions.MANAGE_EVENTS | Permissions.MANAGE_THREADS,
    )
    async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext):
        ...
    ```

Multiple permissions are defined with the bitwise OR operator `|`.

### Blocking Commands in DMs

You can also block commands in DMs. To do that, just set `dm_permission` to false.

```py
@slash_command(
    name="my_guild_only_command",
    dm_permission=False,
)
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext):
    ...
```

## Checks

Checks allow you to define who can use your commands however you want.

There are a few pre-made checks for you to use, and you can simply create your own custom checks.

=== ":one: Built-In Check"
    Check that the author is the owner of the bot:

    ```python
    from interactions import SlashContext, check, is_owner, slash_command

    @slash_command(name="my_command")
    @check(is_owner())
    async def command(ctx: SlashContext):
        await ctx.send("You are the owner of the bot!", ephemeral=True)
    ```

=== ":two: Custom Check"
    Check that the author's username starts with `a`:

    ```python
    from interactions import BaseContext, SlashContext, check, slash_command

    async def my_check(ctx: BaseContext):
        return ctx.author.username.startswith("a")

    @slash_command(name="my_command")
    @check(my_check)
    async def command(ctx: SlashContext):
        await ctx.send("Your username starts with an 'a'!", ephemeral=True)
    ```

=== ":three: Reusing Checks"
    You can reuse checks in extensions by adding them to the extension check list

    ```python
    from interactions import Extension

    class MyExtension(Extension):
        def __init__(self, bot) -> None:
            super().__init__(bot)
            self.add_ext_check(is_owner())

    @slash_command(name="my_command")
    async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext):
        ...

    @slash_command(name="my_command2")
    async def my_command_function2(ctx: SlashContext):
        ...
    ```

    The check will be checked for every command in the extension.


## Avoid redefining the same option everytime

If you have multiple commands that all use the same option, it might be both annoying and bad programming to redefine it multiple times.

Luckily, you can simply make your own decorators that themselves call `@slash_option()`:
```python
def my_own_int_option():
    """Call with `@my_own_int_option()`"""

    def wrapper(func):
        return slash_option(
            name="integer_option",
            description="Integer Option",
            opt_type=OptionType.INTEGER,
            required=True
        )(func)

    return wrapper


@slash_command(name="my_command", ...)
@my_own_int_option()
async def my_command_function(ctx: SlashContext, integer_option: int):
    await ctx.send(f"You input {integer_option}")
```

The same principle can be used to reuse autocomplete options.

## Simplified Error Handling

If you want error handling for all commands, you can override the default error listener and define your own.
Any error from interactions will trigger `CommandError`. That includes context menus.

In this example, we are logging the error and responding to the interaction if not done so yet:
```python
import traceback
from interactions.api.events import CommandError

@listen(CommandError, disable_default_listeners=True)  # tell the dispatcher that this replaces the default listener
async def on_command_error(self, event: CommandError):
    traceback.print_exception(event.error)
    if not event.ctx.responded:
        await event.ctx.send("Something went wrong.")
```

There also is `CommandCompletion` which you can overwrite too. That fires on every interactions usage.

## Custom Parameter Type

If your bot is complex enough, you might find yourself wanting to use custom models in your commands.

To do this, you'll want to use a string option, and define a converter. Information on how to use converters can be found [on the converter page](../08 Converters).

## Prefixed/Text Commands

To use prefixed commands, instead of typing `/my_command`, you will need to type instead `!my_command`, provided that the prefix you set is `!`.

Hybrid commands are are slash commands that also get converted to an equivalent prefixed command under the hood. They are their own extension, and require [prefixed commands to be set up beforehand](/interactions.py/Guides/26 Prefixed Commands). After that, use the `setup` function in the `hybrid_commands` extension in your main bot file.

Your setup can (but doesn't necessarily have to) look like this:

```python
import interactions
from interactions.ext import prefixed_commands as prefixed
from interactions.ext import hybrid_commands as hybrid

bot = interactions.Client(...)  # may want to enable the message content intent
prefixed.setup(bot)  # normal step for prefixed commands
hybrid.setup(bot)  # note its usage AFTER prefixed commands have been set up
```

To actually make slash commands, simply replace `@slash_command` with `@hybrid_slash_command`, and `SlashContext` with `HybridContext`, like so:

```python
from interactions.ext.hybrid_commands import hybrid_slash_command, HybridContext

@hybrid_slash_command(name="my_command", description="My hybrid command!")
async def my_command_function(ctx: HybridContext):
    await ctx.send("Hello World")
```

Suggesting you are using the default mention settings for your bot, you should be able to run this command by `@BotPing my_command`.

As you can see, the only difference between hybrid commands and slash commands, from a developer perspective, is that they use `HybridContext`, which attempts
to seamlessly allow using the same context for slash and prefixed commands. You can always get the underlying context via `inner_context`, though.

Of course, keep in mind that supporting two different types of commands is hard - some features may not get represented well in prefixed commands, and autocomplete is not possible at all.
