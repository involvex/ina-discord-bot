"Technically, there is no need for an ``await`` if there is an object "
"found in the cache. Because of the fact, that, as long as you don't "
"enforce the cache, the function will get the object from HTTP, if it is "
"not in the cache, you still have to await it. This has been done to "
"reduce confusion on whether the object origins from an HTTP call or a "
"cache result and to remove the extra step for you to check if the "
"returned object is an awaitable or not."
