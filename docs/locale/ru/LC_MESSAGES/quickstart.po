"``@bot.command()`` -- This is something known as a *decorator* in Python."

"While, granted that application commands are way more intuitive and "

"some may not want to always type the same command over and over again to "
"repeat a repetitive task. Introducing: **context menus.** Also known as "
"\"user\" and \"message\" respectively, this simple switch in command "

"Components are ways of being able to select pre-defined data, or define "

"This code block below shows a simplified implementation of a component:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../quickstart.rst:285
msgid ""
"This is a design that we ended up choosing to simplify responding to "
"buttons when someone presses on one, and to allow bot developers to plug "
"in *which* button they want a response to. No more ``wait_for_component``"
" and ``wait_for`` functions with huge if-else chains; this removes "
"redundancy in your code and overall eases into the practice of "
"modularity."

msgid "What kinds of components are there?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../quickstart.rst:294
msgid ""
"As a bot developer, this may be fairly important for you to want to know."
" Different components provide difference user experiences, interactions "

"Discord provides: a ``Button``, ``SelectMenu`` and ``TextInput``. You're "
"able to `find these component types`_ here."

"You are also able to organize these components into rows, which are "

"maximum of 5 per message that you send. This code block below shows how:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../quickstart.rst:330
msgid ""
"By default, the ``components`` keyword-argument field in the context "
"sending method will always support ``ActionRow``-less sending: you only "
"need to declare rows whenever you need or want to. This field will also "
"support raw arrays and tables, if you so wish to choose to not use our "
"class objects instead."

msgid "Adding v2 Permissions"

"v2 permissions consist of the ``default_member_permissions`` and "

"intents, you add permissions (like admin-only, ``BAN_MEMBERS``-only, "
"etc.) as follows:"
msgstr ""

"Adding guild-only commands is easier as the only thing it takes is a "

"Likewise, setting ``dm_permission`` to ``True`` makes it usable in DMs. "
"Just to note that this argument's mainly used for global commands. Guild "
"commands with this argument will have no effect."
