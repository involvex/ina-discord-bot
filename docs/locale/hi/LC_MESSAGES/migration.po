msgid "4.0.1 → 4.0.2"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:10
msgid ""
"The biggest major change between these two versions is the way "
"``HTTPClient`` and modelled API schema objects are used. In ``4.0.2``, a "
"new ``_client`` attribute is added in model objects in order to use "
"helper methods. This will not be needed if you're working with dispatched"
" events from the Gateway, however, manually generating your own model "
"object for use will need it appended as a key-word argument. The example "
"below shows this change:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:25
msgid ""
"This change was added in favor for being able to use endpoints in an "
"abstracted state."

#: ../../migration.rst:28
msgid "4.0.2 → 4.1.0"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:30
msgid ""
"``4.1.0`` introduces numerous breaking changes that affect the bot "
"developers' ability to work with mainly modifying the way our Gateway "
"processes information, as well as supplying a ``reason`` argument to "
"``HTTPClient``-based methods."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:33
msgid ""
"In this version, you are no longer required to give a ``reason`` for "
"every HTTP request. You can instead send it as an optional, which will "
"work to keep any existing modifications of our codebase from breaking."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:36
msgid ""
"Additionally, modifying the way information is dispatched from the "
"Gateway must be done like this now:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:49
msgid ""
"We recommend that working in correspondence with this, you should be "
"making use of our ``interactions.ext`` SDK framework."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:51
msgid ""
"A slight, yet another breaking change we made was dundering numerous "
"attributes in our internal models. You will now need to refer to the "
"client's HTTP object as ``_http`` instead of ``http``. In order to view "
"the full list of these, we highly encourage you to view the documentation"
" readily available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:55
msgid ""
"The last, and most major change is the introduction of the "
"``MESSAGE_CONTENT`` privileged intent in the library. Because of "
"``4.1.0`` using version 10 of the Discord API, this intent is now "
"required for reading all message content. In order to make sure your bot "
"works still, you will need to enable this intent in your bot's developer "
"portal and add the intent to your current intents when connecting:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:67
msgid "4.1.0 → 4.3.0"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:69
msgid ""
"A new feature was added; an event called ``on_start``. Unlike "
"``on_ready``, this event is only dispatched when the bot is first "
"started."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:72
msgid "Instead of using the ``on_ready`` event and a check to only run code once:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:86
msgid "You can now utilize the ``on_start`` event to achieve the same goal:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:96
msgid ""
"Another big change in this release is the implementation of the ``get`` "
"utility method. It allows you to no longer use ``**await bot._http...``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:99
msgid ""
"You can get more information by reading the "
":meth:`interactions.client.get.get`-documentation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:102
msgid ""
"``4.3.0`` also introduces a new method of creating commands, subcommands,"
" and options. There are also numerous new features, such as a default "
"scope and utilities."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:105
msgid ""
"The following example shows and explains how to create commands "
"effortlessly and use new features mentioned above:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migration.rst:213
msgid ""
"Another change in ``4.3.0``: We added converters! These allow you name "
"your argument in your function differently than your option name! "
"Example:"
