SDK Framework
=============

Are you trying to build your own 3rd party library, but you don't want to monkey-patch your own
solutions into the current existing library codebase? Are you wanting to avoid having to modify
the architecture of the library to specifically suit you or others needs? Well, now we have
something to introduce to you: ``interactions.ext``. The officially given software development kit
(SDK) tools suite made by developers, and for developers.

Currently, this framework is not out quite just yet -- we'll be seeing ourselves writing more
information about this after the launch of version ``4.0.0-beta``. Stay tuned!
