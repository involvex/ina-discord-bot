Welcome to discord-py-slash-command's official documentation!
====================================================

discord-py-slash-command is a simple discord.py library extension
for using Discord's new Slash Command feature.

Before going into the advanced sections that guide you through
added more complex stuff documentation-wise, it is highly recommended
to check out the `quickstart`_ page first from here or below in the contents.

If there are any questions that you have about the documentation
of this library extension that the docs do not currently cover over, please
feel free to reach out to others on the `Discord`_ server or by starting a
discussion on GitHub!
