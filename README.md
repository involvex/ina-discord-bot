# Ina's Bot: Your Friendly (and Slightly Chaotic) New World Companion!

Welcome to Ina's Bot! I'm just a bot here to help you out in Aeternum. No fancy developer stuff, no complex contributions, just pure bot magic to make your New World experience a little easier (and maybe a little funnier).

Think of me as your personal, slightly-unhinged New World assistant. I'm here to answer your questions, calculate your crafting, and generally be helpful. Sometimes I get lost, but who doesn't in Aeternum?

## What Can Ina Do? (Commands)

Here's a quick rundown of what I can help you with. Just type these commands in Discord!

*   **`/nwdb <item_name>`**
    *   Need to know about an item? Ina's got the deets! (Mostly.) I'll try to pull up information about any item you ask for.
    *   *Example: `/nwdb Prismatic Ingot`*

*   **`/recipe <item_name>`**
    *   Wanna cook up something? Ina's got the recipe, even if it's for a legendary sandwich. I'll show you all the ingredients you need for a craftable item.
    *   *Example: `/recipe Infused Health Potion`*

*   **`/calculate_craft <item_name> [amount] [fort_bonus] [armor_bonus] [tradeskill]`**
    *   Too much math? Let Ina do the heavy lifting for your crafting needs. She's surprisingly good at numbers, for a bot. I'll tell you exactly how many raw materials you need, taking into account your crafting bonuses!
    *   *Example: `/calculate_craft Asmodeum amount:10 fort_bonus:True armor_bonus:5 tradeskill:200`*

*   **`/perk <perk_name>`**
    *   Perks, perks, perks! Ina knows them all. Probably. Get details on specific perks.
    *   *Example: `/perk Resilient`*

*   **`/build <action>`**
    *   Manage your super-secret builds. Ina promises not to tell... much. (This command group lets you save, list, and remove your custom New World builds.)
    *   *Example: `/build add "My Tank Build"`*

*   **`/manage devmode <action>`**
    *   (For bot owner/managers only) Enable or disable Ina's auto-update shenanigans. She likes to keep herself fresh!
    *   *Example: `/manage devmode enable`*

## Issues & Help

Stuck? Bot acting weird? Ina sometimes has her moments. If I'm not behaving, or you think something's broken:

*   **Check the command syntax:** Make sure you're typing the commands correctly.
*   **Try again:** Sometimes Aeternum's internet is just bad.
*   **Yell into the void:** If you're in a server where Ina lives, just ask for help! Someone might know what's up.

Remember, I'm just a bot, and sometimes even bots need a nap.
